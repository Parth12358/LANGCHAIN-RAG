PSU Affiliates

All individuals with an active Penn State access account and a Penn State email address may request access to Roar by submitting an account request. A Principal Investigator (PI) must be specified to request an account. The PI must be Penn State faculty and should be a supervisor, advisor or collaborator. Roar Collab (RC) accounts are granted to any users upon PI approval, but Roar Restricted (RR) accounts are only granted to individuals that require access to an active restricted storage allocation. For additional information on RR account activation, see the Roar Restricted Addendum.
Non-PSU Affiliates

For any external collaborators, a university faculty member must set up a sponsored access account with the university Accounts Office to provide the collaborator with an access account and a Penn State email address. Once the collaborator's access account is active, submit an account request.
Connecting to Roar

Users can connect to RC either through the RC Portal (rcportal.hpc.psu.edu) or via an ssh connection to the submit.hpc.psu.edu host.

Users can only connect to RR via the RR Portal (rrportal.hpc.psu.edu), and RR is only accessible when connecting either via the Penn State network or via the Penn State GlobalProtect VPN. For additional information on connecting to RR, see the Roar Restricted Addendum.
Roar Portals

Users can connect to Roar through the Roar Portals powered by Open OnDemand. Open OnDemand is an NSF-funded, open-source HPC portal that provides users with a simple graphical web interface to HPC resources. Users can submit and monitor jobs, manage files, and run applications using just a web browser. The Roar Portals feature multiple built-in tools which can be accessed via the top menu bar on the Portals:

    Apps: Lists all available Portal apps
    Files: Provides a convenient graphical file manager and lists primary accessible file locations
    Jobs: Lists active jobs and allows use of the Job Composer
    Clusters: Provides shell access to submit nodes on RC
    Interactive Apps: Provides access to all the Portal interactive apps and interactive servers
    User Tools: Provides access to the User Filesystem Quotas display
    My Interactive Sessions: Lists any active sessions

File Manager tool is disabled on RR Portal.

In accordance with RR's Secure Data Transfer Management Model, the File Manager tool on the RR Portal is disabled. For additional information on the file transfer process for RR, see the Roar Restricted Addendum.
Connecting via ssh

Those who prefer to utilize only the command line environment can connect to RC using Secure Shell (SSH). SSH access for RR is disabled in accordance with security requirements for handling restricted data.

Through the terminal on macOS or Linux or the command prompt on Windows, users can connect to RC using the following command:

$ ssh <userid>@submit.hpc.psu.edu

To connect, an RC account linked to an active Penn State access account user ID and password is required. By default, port 22 is used for secure shell connections. A password must be entered and then multi-factor authentication must be completed successfully to complete the login.

Do Not Perform Computationally Intensive Tasks On Submit Nodes

The connection to the system is made with a submit node. Submit nodes are configured primarily to handle incoming user connections and non-intensive computational tasks like editing small files. To perform computational tasks, compute resources must be used. See Submitting Jobs for more details.
